								<p>Creating value out of being curious about and together with other people - it's as simple as that. 
									It's what I've studied in several degrees and what I've been paid to do for 7+ years now.</p>
								<p>If you catch me in real life, I'm probably supervising studies, enabling and mentoring teams, or discussing strategy.</p>
								<p>I most enjoy making sure that insights are generated properly and integrated well into complex frameworks with diverse goals (user-centricity, revenue, sustainability, regulation...). 
									But I also don't mind getting my hands dirty and conducting research myself. My toolbox is multimethod: from qual (e.g. interviews, observation, testing) to quant  
									(e.g. surveys, SQL, Python) and beyond (e.g. physiology, eye tracking, lab work).</p>
								<p>In the other sections, I hope you'll find a glimpse of how I approach users as the real people they are, and conceptualise solutions as a continous process.</p>

						<!-- CSAT Pyramid -->
						<article id="pyramid">
							<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-cubes"></i> CSAT Pyramid</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/fork.jpg" alt="Forked path in a forest"/></span>
							<h3 class="major">What do we do?</h3>
							<p>It happens - after a reorg, a new market situation, or simply your usual time-box of work (sprint, quarter, cycle...) just finished. When you sit together in a room and wonder - what next?</p>
							<p>From a user perspective, it's often easier to come up with options than we assume. Walking up to any researcher on a given team, I bet you they could name at least a handful of things to address (as long as they were given at least some time for explorative research in their day to day). When they suggest these things, the response is often "Well, we don't know about the priority. How would you prioritize initiative X from our users' perspective?"</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pyramid_1.png" alt="CSAT Pyramid general"/></span>
							<p>This graphic gives an idea of what my answers look like nowadays. I like to refer to one of my frameworks called the CSAT Pyramid. It is based on a hierarchy of value props for users. At the bottom, the very fundamental proposition of "Access". It offers users the basic things necessary to even engage with products in a worthwhile manner. Going up the hierarchy we pass other tiers and value props until we reach "Transformation", a very aspirational vision of what can be done for users. Now, within these tiers, we can place relevant Pain Relivers (PRs) and Gain Creators (GCs) - the elements of user experience and jobs we address in delivering our value. Finally, an initiative can be conceptualised to support some of these PRs and GCs. Or even create new ones.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pyramid_2.png" alt="CSAT Pyramid example"/></span>
							<p>Example: Let's say initiative X is a new navigation.</p>
							<p><b>Which PRs and GCs can be addressed (if done correctly)?</b><br>On a fundamental level, websites and apps can be pretty complex and confusing (Pain), we must enable users to find what they need (PR). Also, often users can be made aware of additional things they have a valid interest in (Gain), and navigation elements can draw attention to this (GC). We can also identify another PR higher up - let's skip this for now.</p>
							<p><b>How important is addressing these?</b><br>Step 1: How well are we already performing these PRs and GCs? This is what researchers should be able to say or find out anyway. The more room for improvement we still have, the more important this initiative. Step 2: Next - and this is the critical UX question - where in the hierarchy are these PRs and GCs? This is what the Pyramid will tell you. The <i>lower</i> your PRs/GCs, the higher the initiative's importance! (Step 3: Of course, integrate the assessment with your current overall strategy.)</p>
							<p><b>New navigation?</b><br>The first two PR and GC are at the very foundation of the pyramid. If we doubt the performance of our current navigation in these respects, we should therefor definitely invest in the initiative (given it fits other strategic goals). The (not further specified) PR higher up may be nice to have, but it's not central to the decision.</p>

											<td>Out of dissatisfaction with my own gut-feeling priorities, I created a crucial instrument for strategical UX decisions. Its core maxim: If users can't even use your product for their basic jobs, don't bother with any fancy value props. "Well, duh..." Well, what I've learned over the years: You need to spell out your value props and the PRs and GCs. You need a framework like the CSAT Pyramid when a new fork in your road of initiatives comes up. Otherwise your assessments are liable to biases and remain (educated) guess work.</td>

						<!-- Live Test Surveys -->

							<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-pills"></i> Live Test Surveys</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/cars.jpg" alt="Two cars next to each other"/></span>
							<h3 class="major">How do we do it?</h3>
							<p>You figured out the next big initiative! We're building a new navigation! It's going well, the usual discovery work is fruitful. After some designing and offline testing in the lab, it's time for a live A/B test. You get lots of analytics data of people clicking and being funneled - but how are they expriencing it?</p>
							<p>What happens usually: Decisions are based on behavioral KPIs (e.g. traffic or conversions) and experiential considerations (e.g. satisfaction or the "whys?") only come back in after release, if at all. Maybe you measure continuous CSAT? And as soon as your new navigation drops, the score does, too. Oh oh...</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/abtest_1.png" alt="Live testing w/o CSAT"/></span>
							<p>This is when I first have to explain to you, stakeholder, that I cannot say if the new navigation is responsible. Maybe something happened in the market at the same time and we get angry comments on both. But second, I say we should simply avoid this uncertainty AND the negative outcome next time. Remember that this is <i>exactly</i> why we do A/B tests! We just need to include our users' direct feedback!</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/abtest_2.png" alt="Live testing /w CSAT"/></span>
							<p>How does it work?</p>
							<p><b>1. Create a survey</b><br>Fairly straight-forward. I mean, if you know how to do surveys well in general. The survey expert on your team just needs to understand which components of experience are critical for a given experiment (it took me a few iterations to get it down) and craft it into your usual survey tool.</p>
							<p><b>2. Enrich your data</b><br>This is the difficult, but crucial step. We need to label cases with at least their test bucket (maybe more data points, e.g. interaction with our new navigation) Depending on your tool set-up this may work in different ways.</p>
							<p><b>3. Run the test + analyse!</b><br>We'll be able to do the usual analysis, PLUS check user experience of the new feature. In the case outlined above: We'd learn that users may use the new navigation more but to their own frustration - reporting lower CSAT. With the additional survey data, ideally we'd already know how to fix this.</p>

And I have yet to see a feature roll out after this extended testing and crash my beloved CSAT score.</td>

						<!-- Democratization -->
						<article id="democratization">
							<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-users"></i> UXR Democratization</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/gift.jpg" alt="Person handing flower towards camera"/></span>
							<h3 class="major">Who does what?</h3>
							<p>I like doing UX Research. I like it so much, that I want others to have the experience as well.</p>
							<p>On top of my personal feelings, there are objective reasons for UXR Democratization. Understanding of users becomes more wide spread and reliable. Satisfaction of seeing the impact of your work becomes available to more stakeholders. Ideally (this takes the most time), scientific/methodological competence increases overall (i.e. teams really know how to be "data-driven"). So whom to enable and how?</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/demo_1.png" alt="UXR Democratization people"/></span>
							<p>Here is an overview of functions I've been able to share UXR practice with. Some of them are probably according to your expectation. Other ones raise an eyebrow here or there when I talk about it. Are you trying to imagine a CPO holding a presentation on which button position is better?</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/demo_2.png" alt="UXR Democratization process"/></span>
							<p>This may make things look a little more reasonable.</p>
							<p><b>The concept:</b><br>What you see is a model of introducing stakeholders to UXR in stages. Leveling up their skills bit by bit, but only as much as is possible and feasible. From left to right, an entire research endeavour is depicted (this could be a single task like a user test or a survey, or it could be a full study including multiple components). The first stage begins at the middle of this axis and then subsequent ones reach out further and further towards the edges.</p>
							<p><b>The reasoning:</b><br>Why I start at the center (and then work outwards) is twofold: In terms of UX expertise you find the execution of a given research method here - which is usually somewhat straight-forward and easy to create guidelines/trainings for. And at the same time this work is isolated from other stakeholders and therefor any implementation steps - which means a UX sparring partner can still step in and make sure the immediate research findings are processed and communicated in the correct manner. Only with successful mastering of these first responsibilities, more complicated skills and extended outcome management is encouraged.</p>
							<p><b>The implementation:</b><br>I've intoduced and experimented with several formats. They include low-threshold introductions to user interactions, sprint-like trainings, on-demand knowledge videos, asynchronous supervision and a few more. The tailoring of this offering - as well as UXR Democratization in general - is still very much a work in progress, and I'm excited to figure it out more.</p>

							<p>This table is a reference on what to tackle to make users happy soon and in a sustainable manner. (FYI: All data in this section is fake.)</p>
							<p>In the real world, i.e. not in a tightly controlled experimental setup, it is hard to know why KPIs like Customer Satisfaction are moving.
								That still doesn't mean we can just pick initiatives and measures willy-nilly, right? So when the time came to tackle this issue for our customers, I did some number crunching and came up with an educated, data-driven guess on what should have an impact.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/csat_story.gif" alt="Exploratory look at some CSAT data" /></span>
							<p>It all started with some data exploration. A couple of Jupyter Notebooks and Tableau Dashboards later, I had figured out which analyses to consider. The main idea: Where there is no one gold-standard
								source of truth, triangulate with as many good evidence points as possible. 
								This led to a host of desk and textbook research ("does this make sense?"), correlational and regressional calculations ("is there a relationship?"), and time series observations ("are these closely linked?").
								And eventually a list of main driver assumptions - which were promptly used to guide OKR creation!

							<p>This is a matrix which illuminates some blind spots found in typical approaches to product evaluation.</p>
							<p>When focusing exclusively on satisfaction (as is often done), two things started to stand out to me:<br>
								- You can only ask people who use the product and who do so consciously (but there can be other relevant groups).<br>
								- You are often left with follow-up "Why though?"-questions (so you need more dimensions to faciliate hypothesis generation).<br>
								I started developing a framework which tackles both issues. Certain data behavior in this framework is to be expected for good products, deviations may highlight issues.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/bsat_ex.PNG" alt="Active User Acceptance Example" /></span>
							<p>So far it seems the additional dimensions are best collected via survey in a big sample. This helps with standardization (item phrasing) and reliability. 
								Currently I'm trying to validate the concept by cross-checking the hypotheses it generates (and their usefulness in practice).
