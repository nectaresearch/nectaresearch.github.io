								<span class="image main"><img src="images/intro.jpg" alt="Two people having coffee" /></span>
								<p>Creating value out of being curious about and together with other people - it's as simple as that. 
									It's what I've studied in several degrees and what I've been paid to do for 5+ years now.</p>
								<p>If you catch me in real life, I'm probably supervising studies, enabling and mentoring teams, or discussing strategy.</p>
								<p>I most enjoy making sure that insights are generated properly and integrated well into complex frameworks with diverse goals (user-centricity, revenue, sustainability, regulation...). 
									But I also don't mind getting my hands dirty and conducting research myself. My toolbox is multimethod: from qual (e.g. interviews, observation, testing) to quant  
									(e.g. surveys, SQL, Python) and beyond (e.g. physiology, eye tracking, lab work).</p>

								<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-comments"></i> CoCuDi Guidebook</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cocudi_screenshot.PNG" alt="Screenshot of guidebook iteration" /></span>
								<p>The CoCuDi guidebook is a digital support tool for NGO stakeholder interaction.</p>
								<p>CoCuDi is working in the field of academic development cooperation. They do so by connecting various international contributors to the art industry - such as
									universities, scholars, curators, sponsors, and ministries. With their NGO growing rapidly, they needed a customized onboarding and documentation platform. 
									In a volunteer group of HMI peeps, we helped them out.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/cocudi_framework.PNG" alt="Framework overview for CoCuDi research" /></span>
								<p>As the research expert in the team, I focused on semi-structured in-depth interviews (because there was no pre-existing strategy for CoCuDi's digital experience).
									 To get a systemic overview, I talked to people from several different future user groups 
									across the globe (Israel, Uganda, Germany). An interesting web of synergistic, as well as conflicting needs arose. To find the best solution for our engineers' implementation, 
									I worked with Value Proposition Canvases
									and Point-of-View Frames.

						<!-- App Search -->
						<article id="appsearch">
							<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-search"></i> App Search Flow</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/app_flow.gif" alt="Search flow on IS24 gif" /></span>
							<p>This is a prototyical search flow in 2020 on Germany's #1 real estate portal.</p>
							<p>It includes A LOT of neat features like key word search, draw search, map pin states, elaborate filters etc. etc. 
								Most of these features were within the research scope of my amazing UX colleagues. At some point they had successfully supported 
								so many discoveries, that the app search functionality had become quite expansive. 
								So, a touch-up of the overall flow became necessary.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/app_screens.PNG" alt="Feedback on individual search screens" /></span>
							<p>This was a usability-heavy project. I conducted user tests remotely on simulated and participant devices. 
								Afterwards designs were re-evaluated, some functionalities emphasized, some de-emphasized, some interactions changed, and some colors switched as necessary. 
								KPIs pre/post-release: We are seeing higher search efficiency, more feature visibility, and increased search result interaction.

						<!-- CSAT -->
						<article id="csat">
							<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-file-csv"></i> CSAT Drivers</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/csat_table.PNG" alt="Table of Analysis setup" /></span>
							<p>This table is a reference on what to tackle to make users happy soon and in a sustainable manner. (FYI: All data in this section is fake.)</p>
							<p>In the real world, i.e. not in a tightly controlled experimental setup, it is hard to know why KPIs like Customer Satisfaction are moving.
								That still doesn't mean we can just pick initiatives and measures willy-nilly, right? So when the time came to tackle this issue for our customers, I did some number crunching and came up with an educated, data-driven guess on what should have an impact.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/csat_story.gif" alt="Exploratory look at some CSAT data" /></span>
							<p>It all started with some data exploration. A couple of Jupyter Notebooks and Tableau Dashboards later, I had figured out which analyses to consider. The main idea: Where there is no one gold-standard
								source of truth, triangulate with as many good evidence points as possible. 
								This led to a host of desk and textbook research ("does this make sense?"), correlational and regressional calculations ("is there a relationship?"), and time series observations ("are these closely linked?").
								And eventually a list of main driver assumptions - which were promptly used to guide OKR creation!
							</p>

						<!-- BSAT -->
						<article id="bsat">
							<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-border-all"></i> Beyond Sat</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/bsat_matrix.PNG" alt="Matrix of Awareness and Usage" /></span>
							<p>This is a matrix which illuminates some blind spots found in typical approaches to product evaluation.</p>
							<p>When focusing exclusively on satisfaction (as is often done), two things started to stand out to me:<br>
								- You can only ask people who use the product and who do so consciously (but there can be other relevant groups).<br>
								- You are often left with follow-up "Why though?"-questions (so you need more dimensions to faciliate hypothesis generation).<br>
								I started developing a framework which tackles both issues. Certain data behavior in this framework is to be expected for good products, deviations may highlight issues.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/bsat_ex.PNG" alt="Active User Acceptance Example" /></span>
							<p>So far it seems the additional dimensions are best collected via survey in a big sample. This helps with standardization (item phrasing) and reliability. 
								Currently I'm trying to validate the concept by cross-checking the hypotheses it generates (and their usefulness in practice).

						<!-- Raspi -->
							<article id="raspi">
								<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-robot"></i> SnoozeEmgineer</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/raspi_gif.gif" alt="Gif of SnoozeEmgineer in action" /></span>
								<p>The SnoozeEmgineer is a proof of concept implementation of an RPi/EMG interface.</p>
								<p>It's an alarm clock which works squeeze-to-snooze. Alarm going off? Just do some flexing and go back to sleep. 
									I built it because I 
									thought it would be cool to control things with my muscles and there were no powerful 
									DIY solutions available. I still use my 
									smartphone to wake me up – because I don't want to strangle myself with cables in my sleep. But I’m taking 
									suggestions on what to hook up to the sensor next!</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/raspi_scheme.PNG" alt="Scheme of SnoozeEmgineer hardware" /></span>
								<p>The hardware setup is pretty simple: A cheap EMG sensor (Adafruit MyoWare), hooked up (via an ADC) 
									to a RaspberryPi powered by a rechargeable battery (don't want to accidentally fry anyone with 220 V now, do we). 
									Speakers, a button, and a display were added for this particular use case. The Python source code is openly available, just ping me.</p>

						<!-- Shadowing -->
						<article id="shadowing">
							<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-eye"></i> Shadowing</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/shadowing_stickies.png" alt="Stickies of roles during shadowing" /></span>
							<p>This project consisted of stealthily observing everyday work in two big Berlin tech companies.</p>
							<p>Prompted by an interest in ethnographic methods and the chance to get field access, I spent several half-days exploring 
								what working in this environment looks like from the outside. From desktop work to meeting culture to getting coffee, and 
								everything in between.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/shadowing_sketch.png" alt="Sketch of one shadowing location" /></span>
							<p>The setup was very basic - just my sketchbook and some comfortable sneakers (thanks Berlin dresscode!). 
								The endeavour happened in a feedback group of fellow researchers and was supervised by an experienced lecturer. 
								We focused on phases of data collection in a participant observational way, as well as extensive same-day processing,
								including self-observation and reflection. Main take-away: How challenging it is to stay "the other".</p>
						</article>

						<!-- NWA -->
						<article id="nwa">
							<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-home"></i> BER Cribs</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/nwa_graphs.PNG" alt="Screenshot with criteria graph plots" /></span>
							<p>BER Cribs is a customizable algorithm that determines apartment fit to personal needs.</p>
							<p>It can be quite stressful to look for an apartment in Berlin. It's a reality I was aware of from interviews with 
								real estate seekers and then got to experience first-hand. One of my main stressors and pain points? Having to 
								decide whether to send a message, within literal minutes of an object popping up on the market! My solution: A tool which spits out 
								a personalized match score within seconds of feeding it some object data.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/nwa_output.PNG" alt="Jupyter Notebook screenshot example" /></span>
							<p>How does it work? It's based on a so called Nutzwertanalyse - a pretty complex, elaborate procedure of 
								defining assessment criteria, giving them scoring functions, and determining relative weights. A very German engineering kind of 
								procedure imho. But it becomes pretty manageable once you've fit it into a Jupyter Notebook and done some initial set-up.

						<article id="gst">
							<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Psychotherapy POC</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/gst_cover.PNG" alt="Cover of Psychiatry Research" /></span>
							<p>This journal publication showcases a proof of concept in psychotherapeutic care.</p>
							<p>The intervention was conducted to treat personality disordered patients with a short-term protocol in a (sub)acute setting. 
								Two context factors which both add to the challenge of helping patients with severe diagnoses. Our analysis 
								showed significant benefits for the study participants.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/gst_table.png" alt="Table from Paper showing significant p-value" /></span>
							<p>In this study I handled the data evaluation end-to-end. It consisted of a multivariate pre-post analysis of variance in 
								questionnaires, as well as a meta-analysis of benchmark studies from extensive literature research.
								The publication is pay-walled, which is unfortunate, but I hear authors can send out copies to certain people if you reach out to them!

						<!-- CHI -->
						<article id="chi">
							<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-binoculars"></i> Diversity at CHI</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/chi_art.PNG" alt="Photo of #Chiversity crafting" /></span>
							<p>Diversity at CHI was an observational exercise at CHI 2019.</p>
							<p>Something that struck me was the fun and welcoming atmosphere at the conference. I wondered what inspired all the open exchange and cooperation I encountered. 
								My "Why?" inquiry brought up some insights regarding their D&I implementation. They relate e.g. to how these concepts are presented to participants, 
								how the org team deals with gaps and flaws in their strategy, or how attention to detail is emphasized.
							</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/chi_jotts.PNG" alt="Jottings and Designs from CHI observation" /></span>
							<p>This project came about spontaneously. So it made sense to grab and use what was available: my notebook, a pen, and my smartphone camera. 
							In true participant observation fashion, I went about my day as a conference visitor would. Jotting as I meandered from sessions to exhibitions, 
							conducting some informal interviews and twitter snooping in between. Back home, some final sketches of the below-surface processes originated from the experience.</p>

						<!-- Interception -->
						<article id="interception">
							<h2 class="major"><i class="fas fa-cloud"></i> Interception</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/interception_sticky.png" alt="Interception sticky showing levels" /></span>
							<p>Interception was a project of interviewing interviewers about their interviews.</p> 
							<p>It's always intrigued me why, when, and how people conduct interviews in product development - 
								what better way to indulge my curiosity than interviewing them?</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/interception_gat.png" alt="Example of GAT2 transcription" /></span>
							<p>The trigger for Interception was a course on scientific interviewing, and the undertaking 
								passed through an entire cycle of Kruse's Integratives Basisverfahren, including GAT-2 transcription. 
								The biggest AHA moment was experiencing just how much suddenly appeared between the lines while 
								"slowing down" the analytic process.
